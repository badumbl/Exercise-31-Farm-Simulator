# Exercise-31-Farm-Simulator
Dairy farms have got milking animals; they do not handle milk themselves, but milk trucks transport it to dairy factories which process it into a variety of milk products. Each dairy factory is specialised in one product type; for instance, a cheese factory produces cheese, a butter factory produces butter, and a milk factory produces milk.

Let's create a simulator which represents the milk course of life. Implement all the classes in the package farmsimulator.

Exercise 31.1: Bulk Tank
Milk has to be stored in bulk tanks in good conditions. Bulk tanks are produced both with a standard capacity of 2000 litres, and with customer specific capacity. Create the class BulkTank, with the following constructors and methods.

public BulkTank()
public BulkTank(double capacity)
public double getCapacity()
public double getVolume()
public double howMuchFreeSpace()
public void addToTank(double amount) adds to the tank only as much milk as it fits; the additional milk will not be added, and you don't have to worry about a situation where the milk spills over
public double getFromTank(double amount) takes the required amount from the tank, or as much as there is left
Also, implement the toString method for your BulkTank. The toString method describes the tank situation by rounding down the litres using the ceil() method of class Math.

Test your bulk tank with the following program chunk:

    BulkTank tank = new BulkTank();
    tank.getFromTank(100);
    tank.addToTank(25);
    tank.getFromTank(5);
    System.out.println(tank);

    tank = new BulkTank(50);
    tank.addToTank(100);
    System.out.println(tank);
The program print output should look like the following:

    20.0/2000.0
    50.0/50.0
Note that when you call the println() method of the out object of class System, the method receives as paramater an Object variable; in such case, the print output is determined by the overwritten toString() method in BulkTank! We are in front of a case of polymorphism, because the method can work with different types.

Exercise 31.2: Cow
If we want to produce milk, we also need cows. Cows have got names and udders. Udder capacity is a random value between 15 and 40; the class Random can be used to raffle off the numers, for instance, int num = 15 + new Random().nextInt(26);. The class Cow has the following functionality:

public Cow() creates a new cow with a random name
public Cow(String name) creates a new cow with its given name
String getName() returns the cow's name
double getCapacity() returns the udder capacity
double getAmount() returns the amount on milk available in the cow's udders
String toString() returns a String which describes the cow (see the example below)
Cow also implement the following interfaces: Milkable, which describes the cow's faculty for being milked, and Alive, which represents their faculty for being alive.

    public interface Milkable {
    public double milk();
    }

    public interface Alive {
    public void liveHour();
    }
When a cow is milked, all their milk provision is taken to be processed. As long as a cow lives, their milk provision increases slowly. In Finland, milking cows produce 25-30 litres of milk every day, on the average. We simulate this by producing 0.7-2 litres every hour.

If a cow is not given a name, they are assigned a random one from the list below.

    private static final String[] NAMES = new String[]{
        "Anu", "Arpa", "Essi", "Heluna", "Hely",
        "Hento", "Hilke", "Hilsu", "Hymy", "Ihq", "Ilme", "Ilo",
        "Jaana", "Jami", "Jatta", "Laku", "Liekki",
        "Mainikki", "Mella", "Mimmi", "Naatti",
        "Nina", "Nyytti", "Papu", "Pullukka", "Pulu",
        "Rima", "Soma", "Sylkki", "Valpu", "Virpi"};
Implement the class Cow, and test whether it works with the following program body.

    Cow cow = new Cow();
    System.out.println(cow);


    Alive livingCow = cow;
    livingCow.liveHour();
    livingCow.liveHour();
    livingCow.liveHour();
    livingCow.liveHour();

    System.out.println(cow);

    Milkable milkingCow = cow;
    milkingCow.milk();

    System.out.println(cow);
    System.out.println("");

    cow = new Cow("Ammu");
    System.out.println(cow);
    cow.liveHour();
    cow.liveHour();
    System.out.println(cow);
    cow.milk();
    System.out.println(cow);
The program print output can be like the following.

    Liekki 0.0/23.0
    Liekki 7.0/23.0
    Liekki 0.0/23.0
    Ammu 0.0/35.0
    Ammu 9.0/35.0
    Ammu 0.0/35.0
    Exercise 31.3: MilkingRobot
In modern dairy farms, milking robots handle the milking. The milking robot has to be connected to the bulk tank in order to milk an udder:

public MilkingRobot() creates a new milking robot
BulkTank getBulkTank() returns the connected bulk tank, or a null reference, if the tank hasn't been installed
void setBulkTank(BulkTank tank) installs the parameter bulk tank to the milking robot
void milk(Milkable milkable) milks the cow and fills the connected bulk tank; the method returns an IllegalStateException is no tank has been fixed
Implement the class MilkingRobot, and test it using the following program body. Make sure that the milking robot can milk all the objects which implement the interface Milkable!

        MilkingRobot milkingRobot = new MilkingRobot();
        Cow cow = new Cow();
        milkingRobot.milk(cow);
Expected print output:

     Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: The MilkingRobot hasn't been installed
                at farmsimulator.MilkingRobot.milk(MilkingRobot.java:17)
                at farmsimulator.Main.main(Main.java:9)            
        Java Result: 1

Next:

    MilkingRobot milkingRobot = new MilkingRobot();
    Cow cow = new Cow();
    System.out.println("");

    BulkTank tank = new BulkTank();
    milkingRobot.setBulkTank(tank);
    System.out.println("Bulk tank: " + tank);

    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        System.out.println(cow);
        System.out.println("Living..");
        for(int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            cow.liveHour();
        }
        System.out.println(cow);

    System.out.println("Milking...");
    milkingRobot.milk(cow);
    System.out.println("Bulk tank: " + tank);
    System.out.println("");
    }
The print output of the program can look like the following:

    Bulk tank: 0.0/2000.0
    Mella 0.0/23.0
    Living..
    Mella 6.2/23.0
    Milking...
    Bulk tank: 6.2/2000.0

    Mella 0.0/23.0
    Living..
    Mella 7.8/23.0
    Milking...
    Bulk tank: 14.0/2000.0
    Exercise 31.4: Barn
Cows are kept (and in this case milked) in barns. The original barns have room for one milking robot. Note that when milking robots are installed, they are connected to a specific barn's bulk tank. If a barn does not have a milking robot, it can't be used to handle the cow, either. Implement the class Barn with the following constructor and methods:

public Barn(BulkTank tank)
public BulkTank getBulkTank() returns the barn's bulk tank
public void installMilkingRobot(MilkingRobot milkingRobot) installs a milking robot and connects it to the barn bulk tank
public void takeCareOf(Cow cow) milks the parameter cow with the help of the milking robot, the method throws an IllegalStateException if the milking robot hasn't been installed
public void takeCareOf(Collection<Cow> cows) milks the parameter cows with the help of the milking robot, the method throws an IllegalStateException if the milking robot hasn't been installed
public String toString() returns the state of the bulk tank contained by the barn
Collection is Java's own interface, and it represents collections' behaviour. For instance, the classes ArrayList and LinkedList implement the interface Collection. All instances of classes which implement Collection can be iterated with a for-each construction.

Test your class Barn with the help of the following program body. Do not pay to much attention to the class LinkedList; apparently, it works as ArrayList, but the implemantation in encapsulates is slightly different. More information about this in the data structures course!

    Barn barn = new Barn(new BulkTank());
    System.out.println("Barn: " + barn);

    MilkingRobot robot = new MilkingRobot();
    barn.installMilkingRobot(robot);

    Cow ammu = new Cow();
    ammu.liveHour();
    ammu.liveHour();

    barn.takeCareOf(ammu);
    System.out.println("Barn: " + barn);

    LinkedList<Cow> cowList = new LinkedList<Cow>();
    cowList.add(ammu);
    cowList.add(new Cow());

    for(Cow cow: cowList) {
        cow.liveHour();
        cow.liveHour();
    }

    barn.takeCareOf(cowList);
    System.out.println("Barn: " + barn);
The print output should look like the following:

    Barn: 0.0/2000.0
    Barn: 2.8/2000.0
    Barn: 9.6/2000.0
    Exercise 31.5: Farm
Farms have got an owner, a barn and a herd of cows. Farm also implements our old interface Alive: calling the method liveHour makes all the cows of the farm live for an hour. You also have to create method manageCows which calls Barn's method takeCareOf so that all cows are milked. Implement your class Farm, and make it work according to the following example.

    Farm farm = new Farm("Esko", new Barn(new BulkTank()));
    System.out.println(farm);

    System.out.println(farm.getOwner() + " is a tough guy!");
Expected print output:

    Farm owner: Esko
    Barn bulk tank: 0.0/2000.0
    No cows.
    Esko is a tough guy!
Next:

    Farm farm = new Farm("Esko", new Barn(new BulkTank()));
    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    System.out.println(farm);
Expected print output:

    Farm owner: Esko
    Barn bulk tank: 0.0/2000.0
    Animals:
            Naatti 0.0/19.0
            Hilke 0.0/30.0
            Sylkki 0.0/29.0
Next:

    Farm farm = new Farm("Esko", new Barn(new BulkTank()));

    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    farm.addCow(new Cow());

    farm.liveHour();
    farm.liveHour();
    System.out.println(farm);
Expected print output:

    Farm owner: Esko
    Barn bulk tank: 0.0/2000.0
    Animals:
            Heluna 2.0/17.0
            Rima 3.0/32.0
            Ilo 3.0/25.0
Next:

    Farm farm = new Farm("Esko", new Barn(new BulkTank()));
    MilkingRobot robot = new MilkingRobot();
    farm.installMilkingRobot(robot);

    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    farm.addCow(new Cow());
    farm.addCow(new Cow());


    farm.liveHour();
    farm.liveHour();

    farm.manageCows();

    System.out.println(farm);
Expected print output:

    Farm owner: Esko
    Barn bulk tank: 18.0/2000.0
    Animals:
            Hilke 0.0/30.0
            Sylkki 0.0/35.0
            Hento 0.0/34.0
